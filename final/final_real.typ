Answer all questions clearly and completely. Show your work for full credit. Make sure to include units where appropriate. Each question is worth 10 pts. You have 3 hours to complete the exam.

1. Two point charges are placed in vacuum. A charge of +3.00 μC is located at the origin, and a charge of -2.00 μC is located at (0, 0.200) m.  
  + Determine the magnitude and direction of the force on the -2.00 μC charge.  
  + What is the magnitude of the electric field at the midpoint between the two charges?
  + *Extra Credit:* Explain why the Coulomb is an impractical unit.  Some possibly helpful quantities are that Sweden has a population of about $1.05 times 10^7$ with the average mass of one of those people being 74kg.

2. A charged particle with charge -1.50 μC is placed in a uniform electric field of magnitude 2000 N/C pointing upward.

6. A wire of resistivity $1.70 times 10⁻⁸ Ω m$ and cross-sectional area $1.00 times 10⁻⁶ m²$ carries a current of 3.00 A. The wire is 2.00 m long.  
  + Calculate the resistance of the wire.  
  + Determine the potential difference across the ends of the wire.  
  + Calculate the power dissipated in the wire. _Hint: $P = I^2 R = V^2 / R$_.

7. A capacitor in an RC circuit has a capacitance of 4.00 μF and is charged to 10.0 V. The circuit has a resistance of 2.00 times 10³ Ω.  
  + Determine the time constant of the circuit.
  + Explain the physical significance of the time constant.
  + Calculate the voltage across the capacitor 6.00 ms after the circuit begins discharging. _Hint:_ $Q = C V$

  + If the resistance of the loop is 2.00 Ω, calculate the induced current.

10. A resistor of 50.0 Ω, an inductor of 0.100 H, and a capacitor of 2.00 μF are connected in series to an AC source with a peak voltage of 120 V and a frequency of 60.0 Hz.  
  + Calculate the capacitive reactance, inductive reactance, and impedance of the circuit.  
  + Determine the current amplitude in the circuit.

+ *Extra Credit:* A proton is moving at a speed of $2.00 times 10⁶ m/s$ in a region where both electric and magnetic fields are present. In the laboratory frame, the electric field is $harpoon(E) = (0, 500, 0)$ N/C, and the magnetic field is $harpoon(B) = (0, 0, 0.200)$ T. The laboratory observes the fields to be perpendicular to one another.

  The transformations of the fields into a moving reference frame are given by:  

  $E'_parallel = E_parallel$,

  $E'_perp = gamma (E_perp + harpoon(v) times harpoon(B))$,  

  $B'_parallel = B_parallel$,  

  $B'_perp = gamma (B_perp - (1/c^2) harpoon(v) times harpoon(E))$,  

  where $gamma = 1\/sqrt(1 - v^2\/c^2)$ is called the _Lorentz factor_.

    + Transform the electric and magnetic fields into the proton's rest frame.  
    + Discuss how these transformations reveal the relationship between electric and magnetic fields in different reference frames.
